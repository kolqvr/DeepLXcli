# DeepLX CLI Translator with Fallback üöÄ


A command-line tool to translate text using DeepL translation services. It prioritizes a primary DeepLX API endpoint (doesn't really require the api key, you decide) and gracefully falls back to a list of public DeepLX-like endpoints if the primary fails.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Primary API Priority:** Uses a specified primary API endpoint (`https://deeplx.missuo.ru/translate` by default) with an API key for potentially more reliable translations.
*   **Sequential Fallback:** If the primary API fails, it automatically tries a curated list of public fallback DeepLX endpoints *in sequential order* until one succeeds.
*   **Multiple Input Modes:**
    *   Translate text directly from the command line.
    *   Translate the entire content of a text file (`-f` / `--file`).
    *   Use interactive mode for multi-line input (run without text or file arguments).
*   **File Output:** Save the translation result directly to a specified file (`-o` / `--output`). Automatically suggests an output filename if translating a file and no output is specified.
*   **Proxy Support:** Route requests through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy (`-p` / `--proxy` or `PROXY` environment variable).
*   **Show Alternatives:** Display alternative translations if provided by the API (`-a` / `--alternatives`).
*   **Error Handling:** Provides detailed error messages if all endpoints fail, listing the specific error encountered for each URL.
*   **Randomized Headers:** Uses randomized User-Agent strings and associated headers for fallback endpoints to mimic various clients.
*   **Language Support:** Supports source (`auto` detection included) and target language specification.

## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher is recommended (due to `asyncio` and `httpx`).
*   **pip:** Python package installer.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    I'm so sorry, i don't know how does it works so just download the file from [(here.)](https://github.com/kolqvr/DeepLXcli/blob/main/deeplx_cli.py)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    This script requires the `httpx` library for asynchronous HTTP requests.
    ```bash
    pip install httpx
    ```

3.  **Get and Configure the Primary API Key:**

    *   **Why?** The script is configured to use `https://deeplx.missuo.ru/translate` as its primary, preferred endpoint. This endpoint requires an API key for access.
    *   **How?**
        1.  Go to the service provider's website: [https://deeplx.missuo.ru/](https://deeplx.missuo.ru/)
        2.  Follow their instructions to sign up (typically involving GitHub authentication) and obtain your unique API key.
    *   **Configure:**
        1.  Open the `deeplx_cli.py` script in a text editor or VS code.
        2.  Locate the line:
            ```python
            PRIMARY_API_KEY = "GET API FROM https://deeplx.missuo.ru IF NEEDED"
            ```
        3.  **Replace the placeholder key** `"GET API FROM https://deeplx.missuo.ru IF NEEDED"` with the **actual API key** you obtained.
            ```python
            # Example after replacement:
            PRIMARY_API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
            ```

## üí° Usage

The script can be run directly using `python`.

```bash
python deeplx_cli.py [options] [TEXT_TO_TRANSLATE]
```

### Examples

1.  **Translate a Simple String (Auto-detect source, default target EN):**
    ```bash
    python deeplx_cli.py "Bonjour le monde"
    ```

2.  **Translate a String with Specific Languages:**
    ```bash
    python deeplx_cli.py "Hello world" -s EN -t ES
    ```

3.  **Translate from a File:**
    ```bash
    # Translate input.txt (auto-detect source) to Japanese (JA)
    # Save result to output.ja.txt
    python deeplx_cli.py -f input.txt -t JA -o output.ja.txt
    ```

4.  **Translate from a File (Auto-naming Output):**
    If `-o` is omitted when using `-f`, the script will suggest saving to `original_filename.TARGET_LANG.translated.txt`.
    ```bash
    # Translates input.txt to German (DE)
    # Will save to input.DE.translated.txt (after printing the suggested name)
    python deeplx_cli.py -f input.txt -t DE
    ```

5.  **Interactive Mode (for multi-line input):**
    ```bash
    python deeplx_cli.py -s auto -t FR
    ```
    *   Then, type or paste your text.
    *   Press `Enter` after each line.
    *   When finished, press `Ctrl+D` (Linux/macOS) or `Ctrl+Z` followed by `Enter` (Windows).

6.  **Using a Proxy:**
    ```bash
    # Option 1: Command-line argument
    python deeplx_cli.py "Translate this" -t DE -p http://user:pass@proxyserver:port

    # Option 2: Environment variable
    export PROXY="http://user:pass@proxyserver:port"
    python deeplx_cli.py "Translate this" -t DE
    ```

7.  **Show Alternative Translations:**
    ```bash
    python deeplx_cli.py "A complex phrase to translate" -t RU -a
    ```

### Command-Line Arguments

```
usage: deeplx_cli.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-s SOURCE] [-t TARGET] [-p PROXY] [-a] [--html] [-o OUTPUT] [text]

CLI tool to translate text using DeepLX-like APIs with fallback.

positional arguments:
  text                  Text to translate. If omitted and --file is not used, enters interactive mode.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Path to a text file to translate.
  -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE
                        Source language code (e.g., 'EN', 'DE', 'auto'). Default: auto
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        Target language code (e.g., 'EN', 'DE', 'JA'). Default: EN
  -p PROXY, --proxy PROXY
                        Proxy URL (e.g., 'http://user:pass@host:port'). Reads PROXY env var if set.
  -a, --alternatives    Show alternative translations if available.
  --html                Indicate that the input text might contain HTML (basic). Note: Affects payload slightly but DeepLX handling varies.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        File path to save the main translation result.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

1.  **Payload Preparation:** The input text, source language, and target language are formatted into a JSON payload suitable for DeepLX APIs.
2.  **Primary Attempt:** The script first attempts to send the payload to the `PRIMARY_API_URL` using the provided `PRIMARY_API_KEY`.
3.  **Fallback Sequence:** If the primary attempt fails (due to network error, API error, timeout, etc.), the script iterates through the `FALLBACK_URLS` list *in the order they appear*.
4.  **Request Logic:** For each fallback URL, it sends the same payload but uses a randomly selected set of headers (including `User-Agent`) from the `DEVICE_PROFILES` list to mimic different clients. A short delay is added between fallback attempts.
5.  **Success:** If any request (primary or fallback) returns a successful (2xx status) response with the expected JSON structure (`{"data": "translation", ...}`), that translation is returned, and the process stops.
6.  **Failure:** If all endpoints in the primary and fallback lists are tried and none succeed, the script returns an error message along with a detailed list of errors encountered for each attempted URL.

## üåê Supported Languages (in Script)

The script explicitly lists these language codes as potentially supported by the APIs (DeepL itself supports more, but these are often targeted by DeepLX):

`auto`, `BG`, `CS`, `DA`, `DE`, `EL`, `EN`, `ES`, `ET`, `FI`, `FR`, `HU`, `ID`, `IT`, `JA`, `LT`, `LV`, `NL`, `PL`, `PT`, `RO`, `RU`, `SK`, `SL`, `SV`, `TR`, `UK`, `ZH`

*(Note: `auto` means the API should attempt to detect the source language.)*

## üìú Fallback Endpoints (in Script)

The script includes a list of public DeepLX-like endpoints. The availability and reliability of these public endpoints can vary greatly and change without notice. Some might be rate-limited, offline, or require specific request formats not fully handled by this script. *Note: Some URLs in the list might be outdated or non-functional (e.g., one is explicitly marked `(doesn't work)` in the code).*
